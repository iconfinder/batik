      The Batik distribution contains several pre-packaged demos:

    <dl>
      <dt>Squiggle SVG Browser</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <a href="site:browser">Squiggle SVG Browser</a> lets you view SVG
          file, zoom, pan and rotate in the content and select text items in the
          image and much more.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>SVG Rasterizer</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <a href="site:rasterizer">SVG Rasterizer</a> is a utility that can
          convert SVG files to a raster format. The tool can convert individual
          files or sets of files, making it easy to convert entire directories
          of SVG files. The supported formats are JPEG,
          <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>, and
          <abbr title="Tagged Image File Format">TIFF</abbr>, however the design
          allows new formats to be added easily.  In addition (and despite the
          name) the rasterizer tool can also convert SVG files into
          <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>SVG Font Converter</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <a href="site:font-converter">SVG Font Converter</a> lets
          developers convert character ranges from the True Type Font format to
          the SVG Font format to embed in SVG documents. This allows SVG
          document to be fully self-contained and have their rendered
          identically on all systems.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>SVG Pretty Printer</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <a href="site:pretty-printer">SVG Pretty Printer</a> lets
          developers “pretty-up” their SVG files and get their tabulations and
          other cosmetic parameters in order. It can also be used to modify the
          DOCTYPE declaration on SVG files.
