      <title>Overview</title>

      <p>
        Batik is a Java-based toolkit for applications or applets that want to
        use images in the <a href="site:svg11">Scalable Vector
          Graphics (SVG)</a> format for various purposes, such as display,
        generation or manipulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project’s ambition is to give developers a set of 
        <a href="using/architecture.html#coreComponents">core modules</a> that can be
        used together or individually to support specific SVG solutions.
        Examples of <a href="site:modules">modules</a> are the
        <a href="site:parsers">SVG Parser</a>, the
        <a href="site:generator">SVG Generator</a> and the
        <a href="site:dom-api">SVG DOM</a>. Another ambition for the Batik
        project is to make it highly
        <a href="site:extending">extensible</a>&#x2014;for example, Batik
        allows the developer to handle custom SVG elements. Even though the goal
        of the project is to provide a set of core modules, one of the
        deliverables is a full fledged <a href="site:browser">SVG
          browser</a> implementation which validates the various modules and
        their inter-operability. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="uses">
      <title>What Batik can be used for</title>
      <p>
        <img class="floating" src="images/batikUses.jpg" alt="Batik use cases"/>
        With Batik, you can manipulate SVG documents anywhere Java is
        available. You can also use the various
        <a href="site:modules">Batik modules</a> to
        <a href="site:generator">generate</a>, 
        <a href="site:dom-api">manipulate</a> and
        <a href="site:transcoder">transcode</a> SVG images in your
        applications or applets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Batik makes it easy for Java based applications or applets to 
        deal with SVG content. For example, using Batik’s 
        <a href="site:generator">SVG generator module</a>, 
        a Java application or applet can very easily export its
        graphics into the SVG format. Using Batik’s
        <a href="site:swing">SVG viewing component</a>, an application or
        applet can very easily integrate SVG viewing and interaction
        capabilities.  Another possibility is to use Batik’s modules to convert
        SVG to various formats, such as raster images
        (<abbr title="Joint Photographic Expert Group">JPEG</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> or
        <abbr title="Tagged Image File Format">TIFF</abbr>) or
        other vector formats (<abbr title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</abbr> or
        <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, the latter two due
        to the transcoders provided by
        <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a>).
      </p>
      <p>

    <section id="spec">
      <title>The SVG specification</title>
      <p>
        Scalable Vector Graphics, SVG, is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>
        Recommendation. It defines an XML grammar for rich 2D graphics
        which includes features such as transparency, arbitrary geometry, filter
        effects (shadows, lighting effects, etc.), scripting and animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SVG specification states:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable Vector
        Graphics (SVG).  SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional
        graphics in XML [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML10</a>]. SVG
        allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g.,
        paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text.
        Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed and composited
        into previously rendered objects. The feature set includes nested
        transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects and
        template objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        SVG documents can be interactive and dynamic. Animations can be defined
        and triggered either declaratively (i.e., by embedding SVG animation
        elements in SVG content) or via scripting.
      </p>

    <section id="status">
      <title>Implementation status</title>
      <p>
        The latest revision of Batik, release 1.7beta1, is a conformant
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/conform.html#ConformingSVGViewers">static
          SVG implementation</a> and supports
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html">interactivity</a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html">linking</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/script.html">scripting</a> features
        of the SVG specification.  This release supports a nearly complete
        implementation of declarative
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html">animation</a>, too.
      </p> 

      <p>
        See the <a href="site:status">status</a> page for a detailed description
        of the set of SVG features Batik supports.

    <section id="download">
      <title>Download Batik</title>
      <p>
        You can get the Batik distribution, source and binary, from the
        <a href="site:download">download page</a>.
      </p>

      <note>
        All other libraries needed by Batik are included in the distribution.
        As a consequence the Batik archive is quite big, but after you have
        downloaded it, you will not need anything else.
      </note>

      <warning id="SecurityWarning" label="Security warning">
        <p>
          This is a warning that a script security issue was reported in
          the Batik Squiggle browser. Squiggle uses the Rhino scripting
          engine and some features of that engine can be leveraged by
          malicious scripts to gain access to otherwise protected
          resources (like the file system).  This issue was fixed in the
          1.5.1 release of Batik.  If you are using a version of Batik older than
          1.5.1, you should upgrade.
        </p>
