Content of this directory
=========================

This directory contains rasterizer task for Ant. The task can be used to 
convert SVG files to raster format. This has been contributed by 
Henri Ruini (ruini@iki.fi).

The <sources> directory contains source code for the task. To compile the code 
you need to compile Batik first and then compile the task by typing
.\build.bat compile
in this directory. Type 
.\build.bat help
to display other available targets. These commands work only in Windows.

NOTE: Due the internal changes in Ant itself the rasterizer task may not 
work if the Ant in use is a different version from the Ant used to build 
the task. Use the same Ant version to build and to execute task to avoid 
strange problems.

At least JDK 1.3 is needed to build and execute the task.
